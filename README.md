This are some of the public apis that you can read through to help you
build games with DragonRuby GTK.

The repository is "Source Open". Meaning that it's to serve as
documentation assistance. Keep in minde that the copyright is
proprietary and is **NOT** intended to be served under a permissive
license. Eventually, when some form of long term sustainability is
reached, the license will be relaxed.

The assumption here is that you have a
[DragonRuby Game Tool Kit](http://dragonruby.org) license
which grants you rights to use this api.
