This are some of the public apis that you can read through to help you
build games with DragonRuby GTK.

The repository is "Source Open". Meaning that it's to serve as
documentation assistance. Keep in minde that the copyright is
proprietary and is not intended to be serve under a permissive
license. Eventually, when some form of long term sustainability is
reached, the license will be relaxed.

The assumption here is that you have purchased at least the
[DragonRuby Game Tool Kit - Game Jam Edition](http://dragonruby.org)
which grants you rights to use this api for commercial use in your own
video games.
